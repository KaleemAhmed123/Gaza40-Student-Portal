# Gaza40+ API Full Testing Story

Run the collection in this order to test the complete backend flow. This is written as a story, not as feature notes.

## Setup Once

1. Start API: `corepack pnpm dev`
2. Seed DB if needed:
   - `corepack pnpm prisma:seed`
   - `corepack pnpm prisma:seed:admin`
   - `corepack pnpm prisma:seed:regional-admin`
3. Set collection variable `baseUrl` to `http://localhost:4000`.

## Story 1: Basic Server Check

1. `00 Health / Health`
2. `00 Health / Health DB`

## Story 2: Create The Main Test Users

1. `01 Auth / Register Student`
   - Captures `studentCookies`.
   - If student already exists, run `01 Auth / Login Student`.

2. `01 Auth / Register Volunteer`
   - Captures `volunteerCookies`.
   - If volunteer already exists, run `01 Auth / Login Volunteer`.

3. `01 Auth / Login Master Admin`
   - Captures `adminCookies`.

4. `01 Auth / Login Regional Admin`
   - Captures `regionalCookies`.

5. Optional check: `01 Auth / Get Current User`
   - Auth responses return an enriched user object for frontend session bootstrapping: display fields, roles, account status, email verification status, and role-specific profile summaries.

## Story 5: Student Creates And Submits Offer

1. `05 Student Offers / Create Offer`
   - Copy returned offer id into collection variable `offerId`.

2. `05 Student Offers / Get Offer`

3. `03 Documents / Upload Document`
   - Set `documentType=offer_letter`.
   - Set `offerId={{offerId}}`.
   - Pick a PDF/JPG/PNG file.

4. If offer body has scholarship enabled:
   - Run `03 Documents / Upload Document` again.
   - Set `documentType=scholarship_letter`.
   - Keep `offerId={{offerId}}`.

5. `05 Student Offers / Submit Offer`

6. `05 Student Offers / List My Offers`
   - Confirm offer is `under_review`.

## Story 6: Admin Reviews Offer

1. `07 Admin Offer Review / List Offers (Admin)`

2. `07 Admin Offer Review / Get Offer (Admin)`

3. `07 Admin Offer Review / Review Offer - Approve`
