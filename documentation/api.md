- `actorUserId`
- `from`
- `to`
- `page`
- `pageSize`

```powershell
curl.exe -i -b admin.cookies http://localhost:4000/api/admin/audit-logs

## Student Offers

Student offer APIs require an approved student profile.

### `GET /api/student/offers`

Lists the current student's offers with calculated funding summary.

```powershell
curl.exe -i -b student.cookies http://localhost:4000/api/student/offers
```

### `POST /api/student/offers`

Creates a draft offer. Use either `universityId`, `regionId`, or `universityCountry`.

For now, `universityCountry` is the easiest manual-test option and matches seeded regions such as `UK`, `Ireland`, `Italy`, `Spain`, `Egypt`, `US`, `Bosnia`, or `Turkey`. When `universityId` is used later, the backend derives the offer region from the selected university.

```powershell
curl.exe -i -b student.cookies -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/student/offers `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{"universityCountry":"UK","universityName":"Example University","courseName":"MSc Public Health","courseField":"Public Health","courseLevel":"Masters","durationYears":2.5,"programmeStartDate":"2026-09-01","offerType":"Conditional","conditions":"Final transcript required","tuitionFeePerYear":12000,"courseFeeSourceUrl":"https://example.edu/fees","hasScholarship":true,"scholarshipName":"Example Scholarship","scholarshipAmountPerYear":10000,"scholarshipCoversLivingCost":false,"privateFundingAmount":3000,"privateFundingSource":"Family support","livingCostLocationKey":"outside_london"}'
```

### `GET /api/student/offers/:id`

```powershell
curl.exe -i -b student.cookies http://localhost:4000/api/student/offers/OFFER_ID
```

### `PATCH /api/student/offers/:id`

Updates a draft or changes-requested offer. Editing an approved offer creates a revision and moves it back to `under_review`.

```powershell
curl.exe -i -b student.cookies -X PATCH http://localhost:4000/api/student/offers/OFFER_ID `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{"universityCountry":"UK","universityName":"Example University","courseName":"MSc Public Health","courseField":"Public Health","courseLevel":"Masters","durationYears":2.5,"programmeStartDate":"2026-09-01","offerType":"Unconditional","tuitionFeePerYear":12000,"courseFeeSourceUrl":"https://example.edu/fees","hasScholarship":true,"scholarshipName":"Example Scholarship","scholarshipAmountPerYear":10000,"scholarshipCoversLivingCost":false,"privateFundingAmount":3000,"privateFundingSource":"Family support","livingCostLocationKey":"outside_london"}'
```

### `POST /api/student/offers/:id/submit`

Requires active `offer_letter`. If `hasScholarship=true`, also requires active `scholarship_letter`.

```powershell
curl.exe -i -b student.cookies -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/student/offers/OFFER_ID/submit
```

### `DELETE /api/student/offers/:id`

Soft-removes an offer.

```powershell
curl.exe -i -b student.cookies -X DELETE http://localhost:4000/api/student/offers/OFFER_ID
```

## Master Admin Student Profile Review

## Admin Students Grid

Master Admin sees all registered students with profile/offer summary fields. Regional Admin sees only students who have at least one offer in the admin's assigned offer/university region.
Response includes `summary` counts for the current filtered result set. Master Admin receives profile/passport/Gaza-location/consent/verified-offer counts. Regional Admin receives the scoped total only to avoid leaking extra student profile details.

Important:
- `locationInGaza` is the student's Gaza location.
- Regional Admin access is based on `Offer.regionId`, not `StudentProfile.locationInGaza`.

### `GET /api/admin/students`

Optional query:
- `search`
- `profileStatus`
- `passportStatus`
- `locationInGaza`
- `hasVerifiedOffer`: `true` or `false`
- `consentSigned`: `true` or `false`
- `page`
- `pageSize`

Master Admin examples:

```powershell
curl.exe -i -b admin.cookies http://localhost:4000/api/admin/students
```

```powershell
curl.exe -i -b admin.cookies "http://localhost:4000/api/admin/students?profileStatus=approved&locationInGaza=gaza_city&page=1&pageSize=25"
```

Regional Admin example:

```powershell
curl.exe -i -b regional.cookies http://localhost:4000/api/admin/students
```

### `GET /api/admin/students/export`

Exports the same filtered student grid as CSV. Master Admin exports all matching students. Regional Admin exports only students with offers in their assigned offer/university region.
Sensitive document files are not exported as public URLs. If file references are added to CSV exports, they must use document IDs or protected download paths that still require authentication.

```powershell
curl.exe -L -b admin.cookies "http://localhost:4000/api/admin/students/export?profileStatus=approved&locationInGaza=gaza_city" -o students-export.csv
```

```powershell
curl.exe -L -b regional.cookies "http://localhost:4000/api/admin/students/export" -o regional-students-export.csv
```

## Admin Volunteers Grid

Master Admin sees all registered volunteers with status, roles, and profile fields. Regional Admin sees volunteers whose `preferredRegionId` matches the admin's assigned offer/university region.
Response includes `summary` counts for the current filtered result set by volunteer status, role, and preferred region.

Note:
- Regional volunteer scoping currently uses `VolunteerProfile.preferredRegionId`.
- This is the simple MVP interpretation of "volunteers in that region" until explicit volunteer-region assignment rules are added.

### `GET /api/admin/volunteers`

Optional query:
- `search`
- `volunteerStatus`
- `role`
- `preferredRegionId`

```

```powershell
curl.exe -i -b admin.cookies "http://localhost:4000/api/admin/volunteers?role=mentor&search=volunteer"
```

Regional Admin example:

curl.exe -i -b regional.cookies http://localhost:4000/api/admin/volunteers
```

### `PATCH /api/admin/volunteers/:id/assignment`

Updates a volunteer's simple MVP assignment/review state.

Rules:
- Master Admin can set `preferredRegionId`, `volunteerStatus`, and `mentorEnabled`.
- Regional Admin can only manage volunteers already assigned to their own region.
- Regional Admin cannot remove mentor role or assign privileged roles.

```powershell
curl.exe -i -b admin.cookies -X PATCH http://localhost:4000/api/admin/volunteers/VOLUNTEER_USER_ID/assignment `

```

```powershell
curl.exe -L -b regional.cookies "http://localhost:4000/api/admin/offers/export?status=under_review" -o regional-offers-export.csv

## Queries / Ticketing

Queries are in-app tickets raised by students. Email notifications use Resend when `RESEND_API_KEY` is configured, but email is best-effort and never blocks query creation or replies.

Profile and offer review notifications also use the same best-effort email service:
- Profile submission notifies active Master Admins.
- Offer submission or approved-offer edits notify active Regional Admins for the offer region.
- If no Regional Admin exists for an offer region, active Master Admins are notified instead.

Seeded query categories:
- `general_issue`
- `visa_offer_issue`
- `whatsapp_group_issue`

### `POST /api/queries`

Creates a student query. For `visa_offer_issue`, send `regionId`. For `whatsapp_group_issue`, send `offerId` so the backend can derive the region.

```powershell
